    <h3>Spotlight: The Legend of Pelé</h3>
    <p>
        Edson Arantes do Nascimento, known globally as <b>Pelé</b>, is widely regarded as one of the greatest athletes to ever play the game. He is the only player to have won <i>three FIFA World Cups</i>, and his incredible skill helped popularize the sport in the United States. His legacy continues to inspire millions of young players to pick up a ball for the first time.

    <h3>A Brief History of the Beautiful Game</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>1863:</strong> The Football Association is formed in England, establishing the first official rules.</li>
        <li><strong>1930:</strong> The first-ever FIFA World Cup is hosted and won by Uruguay.</li>
        <li><strong>1991:</strong> The inaugural Women's World Cup takes place in China.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        I first started playing soccer in a local youth league, where I learned the importance of <b>dedication and sportsmanship</b>. What interests me most about this sport is how it acts as a "universal language"—no matter where you are in the world, you can start a game with nothing more than a ball and two markers for goals. You can check out current match scores and news at the <a href="https://www.fifa.com" target="_blank">official FIFA website</a>.
